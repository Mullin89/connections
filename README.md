# connections

An attempt to recreate NYT Connections game

Brainstormin':

HTML/CSS - start with a button saying "new game", 4x4 grid, cells change colour when clicked, react with mouse hover, cells contain a word

JS logic - a nested array of linked groups of 4 words, when you click "new game" 4 nested arrays are picked at random, populate the grid with the words, can only select 4, error if less than 4 selected, if 4 are the same show message and move them to the top, show message if 3/4 are correct, life system
